    "In attempting to predict the strength of a concrete mix solely from its ingredients, we were able to obtain an $R^2$ accuracy of **93.66%**, averaged over 10 trials, using XGBoost. This means that concrete compressive strength is quite predictable as early as when it is mixed. Most of the error may be attributable to inconsistencies in the mixing process - concrete strength is not solely dependent on its ingredients, since it can be affected by poor mixing, the ambient temperature, and other factors. Nevertheless, a 94% accuracy is quite high and we can confidently say that it is possible to reliably predict the strength of a concrete mix. This can be very useful, especially because the prevailing method for computing concrete strength (not testing but computing) is very tedious and prone to inaccuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I would not advocate this method as a substitute for proper materials testing such as actual measuring of concrete strength by crushing. This is because many factors affect the strength of concrete, particularly the mixing procedure. It is possible to formulate a concrete mix that has an expected strength of 70 MPa, and only obtain 50 MPa in actuality."
